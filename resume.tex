\section{Experience}

% \subsection{Management}

\cventry{2020--Present}{Engineering Manager}{\textsc{Disney (Acquired
    Hulu)}}{Remote}{}{ Managing the State Authority team, responsible for all
  user content preferences and playback state. This is a team of eight engineers
  and a TPM, and it is responsible for two dozen high scale Java applications
  critical to the cloud DVR, user bookmarks, playback progress, and the ``Continue
  Watching'' user experience. This team is part of the ``Unification'' project, with the goal of producing a single set of backend services capable of supporting the varied feature sets of the various Disney Streaming products, including Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+, and Star+.
    \newline{}\newline{}
    Detailed achievements:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Engineering lead for a company wide initiative to introduce
          unlimited DVR to Hulu. Worked with existing design, front end, and
          middle layer teams to ensure backwards compatibliity, as well as
          design new caching layers to handle increases in backend RPS.
        \item Grew the team by 40\%.
        \item Worked with product to design greenfield unified content
          preferences for all streaming platforms.
        \item Migrated all applications from on-premise services to cloud native
          and AWS hosted solutions ahead of company wide schedule.
        \item Pioneered technique to store alert configuration in Terraform for
          better consistency and maintenance.
        \item Managing a zero downtime, bidirection sync between unified and
          legacy datastores, to provide a seamless user experience across all
          device types during the Disney unification.
        \item Designed a ``cold start'' process to solve the very common problem
          of offline and nearline consumers needing access to bulk data from
          realtime systems. This pattern is now used throughout the entire
          company.
    \end{itemize}}

\cventry{2020}{Engineering Manager}{\textsc{Hulu (Acquired by Disney)}}{Los Angeles/Remote}{}{
  Took over the ``DVR'' team, which managed the Cloud DVR offering for the Hulu Live TV product. This team was eventually renamed to User Settings \& Artifacts, which managed the DVR, user favorite content (``My Stuff''), and Offline Downloads.
  \newline{}\newline{}
    Detailed achievements:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Cut DRV cost by 75\% without loss of performance or feature set.
    \item First incident free Super Bowl for the DVR in Hulu history.
    \item Led team through an unexpected transition to remote work.

      customer impact.
    \item Created task force to drive technical standards forward, and end the
      long standing Hulu norm of every team having their own stack. The
      resulting standards were adopted by multiple teams, drastically improving
      on call performance.
  \end{itemize}}

\cventry{2017--2019}{Engineering Manager}{\textsc{Edmunds.com}}{Los Angeles}{}{
  Responsible for the ``Lead Systems'' team. This team managed the web forms and
  backend systems that collected customer interest (``leads'') in vehicles, and
  transmit that data to dealerships and the OEM. This was a critical component
  for our dealership sales, which accounted for 30\% of company revenue.
\newline
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Planned and led the migration of dozen lead forms across the
          Edmunds website to a single, consistent, and easy to maintain React
          based form.
        \item Designed and released a number of internal tools to improve lead
          form iteration speed.
        \item Created tools for product to introspect lead form behavior without
          engineering support, nearly eliminating internal support requests.
        \item Designed a system for protecting customer data in close
          collaboration with Data Analytics.
        \item Worked closely with Business Development to capitalize on limited
          time business opportunities.
